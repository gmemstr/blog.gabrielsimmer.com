#### DD/MM/YYYY -- a monthly check-in

A lot has happened this month. From NodeMC v5 and v6 to
a new website redesign to a plethora of new project ideas, May is going
to be a much busier month, so I think I should check-in.

NodeMC, one of my most beloved projects thus far, has been going far
better than I could have ever imagined, with more than 30 unique cloners
in the past 30 days and about 300 unique visitors, those have far
outpaced my other projects. And to top it, off, 13 lovely stars. Version
1.5.0 (aka v5) [recently launched with plugin
support](https://nodemc.space/blog/3), and has been a monumental release for me in terms of
what it has taught me and what the contributors and I have achieved. A
big hats-off to [md678685](https://twitter.com/md678685) for helping with the plugin system and other fixes
within in the release. NodeMC v6, however, is going to be even bigger.
[Jared Allard](https://jaredallard.me/) of nexe fame (among other projects) has taken
interest in the project and has rewritten the bulk of it using ES6
standards, which both md678685 and I have been learning, and has
recently decided to rewrite the stock dashboard using the React
framework. I could not be happier working with him on v6.

On a smaller note, [my personal website](http://gabrielsimmer.com)
has had a bit of a facelift. I decided to do so after months of using a
free HTML5 template that really did not offer a whole lot of room to
customize. My new site allows me to add pretty much an unlimited number
of projects and other information as I see fit. It's built using my
favorite CSS framework [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/),
which I will forever see as superior to Bootstrap, despite not being
updated in more than a year (I may have some free time to fork it), and
using a nice font called [Elusive Icons](http://elusiveicons.com/) for
the small icons. I'm throwing the source up on GitHub as I type this
post ([it's up!](https://github.com/gmemstr/GabrielSimmer.com)).

I have a lot of projects in my head. Too many to count or even write
down. It's going to be a crazy few months as some of my more long-term
projects (some of them mine, others I'm just working on) are realized
and launched. I really don't want to say much, but I know that several
online communities, namely the Minecraft and GitHub communities, will be
very excited when I am able to talk more freely on what I have coming
up.

_*Okay, maybe I'll tease one thing -- I recently bought the YourCI.space domain, which I am not just partking!*_

Just a quick heads up as well, everyone should go check out [Software Engineering Daily](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/). I am going to be on the show later next month, but I recommend you subscribe to that wonderful podcast regardless. I will be sure to link the specific episode when it comes out over on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/gmemstr)
