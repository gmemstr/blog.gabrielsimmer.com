#### Keeps the psychiatrist away.

I'm trying to keep up with my streak of a post every day on Medium,
mostly because I've found it really fun to write. I think Wednesdays
will become a sort of 'weekly check-in', going over what I have done and
what there is yet to do.

So, what have I accomplished this week?

-   Created a link shortner.
-   Made the staff page for Creator Studios.
-   Started updating [my homepage](http://gabrielsimmer.com)
-   Fixed an issue with Moat-JS (pushing out soon).
-   Removed mc.gabrielsimmer.com and all the deprecated projects.
-   Moved to Atom for development.

And what do I hope to accomplish?

-   Fix my link shortner.
-   Work on the video submission page for Creator Studios.
-   Whatever else needs doing.
-   Complete my week-long streak of Medium posts.

It's hard to list what I want to accomplish because things just come up
that I have no control over. But nonetheless, I will report back next
Wednesday.

Happy coding!
