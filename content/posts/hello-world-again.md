title: Hello, world! (Again)

Welcome back to the blog! Sort of.

After much thought, I've decided to move my blog off of Medium and back to a place I can fully control. It wasn't really a difficult decision; Medium as a platform has changed a fair amount since I began using it, just as I have. Rather than nuking the entirety of my previous posts, I exported and cleaned them up for archival (although I did seriously consider just starting fresh).

There are some things I should address about these posts. First, they are a product of their time. I don't say that to excuse racism (there is none in these old posts), but rather both my writing style and view of the world. These older posts span from 2015 to 2018, when I was between the ages of 15 and 18 (at the time of this post, I'm 21). I've done my best to clean up the posts after the Medium export, but content left as-is where possible. While I maintain an archive of the original export, I've decided against commiting the raw files and any drafts that my account contained (mostly because they're in very rough states and are mostly for personal nostalgia/reflection).

I will not be editing these older posts. However, posts from this one onwards are fair game!

On the technical side, this site is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate static files. It seemed like the simplest option. Commits run through a CircleCI pipeline (I work there, and am most familiar with the platform, hence no GitHub Actions) and get pushed to a branch that GitHub Pages serves up. There are simpler approaches, but the important thing is that the content is in plaintext, rather than a platform's database, and can be moved to wherever is needed.

I'm unsure how regular posts will be to this blog, but there may be the odd post here and there - follow me on Twitter to be notified, or the [generated RSS feed](https://blog.gabrielsimmer.com/index.xml) - [@gmem_](twitter.com/gmem_).
