#### Loading content has never been smoother

I started web development (proper web development anyways) using pretty much only PHP and HTML -- I didn't touch JavaScript at all, and CSS was usually handled by Bootstrap. I always thought I was doing it wrong, but I usually concluded the same thing every time.

> "JavaScript is too complex. I'll stick with PHP."

Only recently have I been getting into JavaScript, and surprisingly have
been enjoying it. I've been using mainly AJAX and jQuery for GET/POST
requests for loading and displaying content, which I do realize is *just
barely* scratching the surface of what it can do, but it's super useful
because I can do things such as displaying a loading animation while it
fetches the data or provide nearly on-the-fly updating of a page's
content (I am working on updating ServMineUp to incorporate AJAX for
this reason). I'm absolutely loving my time with it, and I hope I'll be
able to post more little snippets of code like I did for
[HoverZoom.js](/posts/hoverzoom-js). Meanwhile, I encourage everyone to try their hand at AJAX & JavaScript. It's powerful and amazing.
