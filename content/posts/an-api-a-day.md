#### Keeps... other productivity away?

[Update: GitHub org is available here with more info & rules.](https://github.com/apiaday)

I've been in a bit of a slump lately, NodeMC hasn't
been as inspiring and development has been a bit slow, other projects
are on hold as I wait for third parties, so I haven't really been
working on much development wise.

#### So I can up with a challenge: **An API A Day**.

The premise is simple -- Every day, I pick a new API to build an
application with from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3wrswc/what_are_some_fun_apis_to_play_with/) (from reddit). From the time I start I have the rest
of the day to build a fully-functional prototype, bugs allowed but core
functionality must be there. And it can't just be a "display all the
data" type app, it has to be interactive in some form.

An example of this is [Artdio](http://gmem.pw/artdio), which was the inspiration for this challenge. I
built the page in about 3 hours using SoundCloud's JavaScript API
wrapper, just as a little "how does this work" sort of challenge.

So how is this going to be organised?

I'm going to create a GitHub organization that will house the different
challenges as separate repositories. To contribute, all you'll need to
do is fork the specific day / API, copy your project into it's own
folder (named YOURPROJECTNAME-YOURUSERNAME), then create a pull request
to the main repository. I don't know the specific order I personally
will be going through these APIs, so chances are I will bulk-create
repositories so you can jump around at your own pace, or you can request
a specific repository be created.
